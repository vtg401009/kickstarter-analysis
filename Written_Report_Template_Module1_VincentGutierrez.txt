# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

The overview of this project is to analyze kickstarter data to assist Louise in understanding the 
fundraising analysis of similar plays to ensure her play Fever will be a success.

### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges

Using what I learned in Module 1 along with previous industry knowledge, I was able to effectively 
use Excel formulas, graphs, pivot tables, and troubleshooting to accurately deliver results.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Based on analysis of Launch Dates, May and June are the best months for theaters. The elast ideal months are 
December - January.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Based on findings of the goals, the most successful projects are goals between $1000 and $4999 with a steep
dropoff in success once the goals start at $20000.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The challenge I faced was making sure the formulas were all working together in the outcomes portion
of the project. To troubleshoot this problem, I went to the raw data and isolated the goals to see where 
my data was dropping off. I was able to see that I was missing an => part in one of my formulas.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Based on analysis of Launch Dates, May and June are the best months for theaters. The elast ideal months are 
December - January.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Based on findings of the goals, the most successful projects are goals between $1000 and $4999 with a steep
dropoff in success once the goals start at $20000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Limitations of this dataset could be the demographic the play was trying to focus on and economic trends.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Other tables and graphs could be Outcomes Based on Pledge Dollars, success and failure rates based 
on country and the count of backers, and also which category and subcategory is the most successful.
